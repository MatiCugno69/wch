    <h2>Fact of the day!</h2>
    <h3>The heads on Easter Island have bodies.</h3>
    <img src="Images/eisland.jpg" alt="Easter Island Heads">
    <p>The iconic stone heads protruding from the ground on Easter Island are
      familiar to most, but many don't realize what lies beneath the surface.
      In the '10s, archaeologists studying the hundreds of stone statues on the
      Pacific Island excavated two of the figures, revealing full torsos, which
      measure as high as 33 feet.</p>
